Changes from version 0.1.1 to version 0.2 - 2012-04-30
  This version introduces the new identity management based on WoT as well as
  the new web interface that includes a simple webmail client. Due to the
  change in identity management this version is not compatible with earlier
  versions and uses a new address format as well as a new default directory. In
  addition to this the Bouncycastle version has been bumped from 1.38 to 1.47,
  as well as numerous other changes.

Changes in version 0.1.1 - 2012-04-30
  o Security fixes:
    - Log message fetch and insert keys at debug instead of normal/error. If a
      collision occurred the new slot would be logged at error, which
      would break the forward secrecy of the slot system until the log was
      deleted. This would enable an attacker with access to the log files to
      retrieve messages from Freenet.

  o Bugfixes:
    - Folders deleted using a mail client are now deleted properly
    - Fixes a crash that could occur if a mail client connected while Freemail
      was shutting down
    - The startup message now shows the correct licence (GPL)
    - Fixes a bug where certain email addresses would cause received messages to
      be empty
    - Fixes a race condition which could lead to Freemail hanging
    - Don't delete CC headers from a message before sending
    - Always print a log message when Freemail isn't connected to the node
    - IMAP: Remove extra space that was printed in a fetch response without a range
    - IMAP: Fix error message when the end of a range was invalid
    - IMAP: Handle strange sequence number ranges
    - IMAP: Remove \* from permanent flags since they were not stored
    - IMAP: Fix append with two or more flags
    - IMAP: Reply with error if the append length couldn't be parsed
    - Fix various locking issues
    - Don't log the recently failed fetch result as an error

  o Improvements:
    - Improve the explanations on the create account page
    - Only resend the RTS once per two days instead of once per message in the
      outbox per two days, reducing resource usage for unacked messages
    - Send messages in the order they will be received, improving performance
      when sending a large amount of messages
    - Alternate between sending and receiving, stopping sending/receiving a large
      number of messages from blocking other operations

  o Build improvements:
    - Compile for Java 1.6
    - Include git describe output in version
    - Enable warnings when building
    - Make Ant and Eclipse output files to the same location (build/)

  o Code changes:
    - Add unit tests for various classes (mostly IMAP)
    - Improve errors returned/thrown by HighLevelFCPClient
    - Add type parameters to all code
    - Add missing @Override annotations
    - Throw AssertionError in some cases that should be impossible
    - Use constants for config file keys
    - Respond to interrupts in the FCP code
